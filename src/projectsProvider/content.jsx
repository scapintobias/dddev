					This kind of representation shows a fictional geography by moving away from
					the concept that transportation maps had to position the underground
					geography directly to the aboveground geography. Such design moves away
					from the idea that the representation has to follow the actual geographical
					route of the lines. By replacing the strict geographically imposed rules,
					that requires that entities represented be placed exactly where they are
					located in the physical world, with a regular pattern of horizontal,
					vertical or diagonal lines the proposed map depicts much more clearly the
					relative locations of the different lines and the sequence of stations. In
					this way, the map turns out to be an useful support in gaining an
					understanding of the complexities of the underground lines, and an aid in
					travel planning. For these reasons it can act as a navigation tool to
					assist in working one’s way through the underground maze of lines and
					stations and as a reference once a journey is underway.

				<Sec title="My Role" />I led the design for the driving interface between
				July and November 2018. I worked alongside the CEO of the company, a project
				manager, a senior industrial designer and a software developer.
				<Br></Br>I stopped working on the project during the UI definition phase to
				focus on another app for the same company.
				<Br></Br>
				The Milestone was achieved shortly after.
				<Sec title="Structure and management" />
				When I arrived, the engineering team had already solved the majority of the
				mechanical issues, and implemented an alpha version of the guiding software,
				allowing to drive the drone by sight, with a standard joypad. The next step
				was to push the development forward, aiming at the completely remote driving
				of the drone, while the driver was comfortably sat in a control room,
				receiving data transmitted from the vehicle's sensors as an input.
				<Br />
				It was therefore essential taking in consideration the filtered visual
				perception, and how to convey visually some digital aids we as humans
				usually perceive from the outer world with our senses.
				<Br />
				During the first step of the project, there had to be acquired some
				knowledge about ugvs (unmanned ground vehicles), both from a mechanical
				point of view: how the chassis is built, how the motors work, which are the
				physical limits of movement given by these motors; and an electronic point
				of view: the type of sensors mounted aboard, what kind of camera is
				available and what type of video is capable of detect, how and which data
				are transmitted from and to the vehicle by the control room, what are the
				features of the programming language used etc.
				<Br />
				This step has been very helpful in defining the limits of the research, and
				understanding how to integrate the interface design into this extremely
				complex system.
				<Sec title="My contribution" />
				Although the drive-by-sight was completely functional, the only features
				already implemented for the remote control were the decoding of the visual
				feed from the camera, and an horizontal white bar advancing as the drone
				accelerated, but with no indication of the actual speed or aids that helped
				you understand the indicator at a glance.
				<Br />
				The role of the designer has actually been, taking advantage of the specific
				knowledge of interaction and interface design, define which were the bare
				minimum requisites for a very fluid remote control, and which were the
				problems to solve for achieving this goal, outlining the research path,
				performing the research, analyse both that data, and the data the engineers
				had been gaining through their set of tests, and use it to deline the
				functionalities. Then the wireframing and sketching would start, followed by
				a working invision prototype, as a proof of concept. Once approved, the
				actual production would begin, with the draw up of the whole documentation
				in anticipation of the handoff. Then, while the developers were implementing
				the first mvp, test sets were customised and later performed, and after few
				months of almost daily iterations the product would be considered finished
				and the milestone achieved.
				<Sec title="The research challenges" />
				After some amount of time trying to deline which were the upmost problems to
				undertake, they can be divided into three groups:
				<div className="orange f2 i">
					First group
					<p className="f3 navy i">Bound to the perception of the driver</p>
				</div>
				<ul className="list indent">
					<li>Resolve the perception of depth</li>
					<li>Resolve the perception of the radius of curvature</li>
					<li>Resolve the perception of the incline</li>
					<li>Resolve the perception of acceleration</li>
				</ul>
				<div className="orange f2 i pt3">
					Second group
					<p className="f3 navy i">Bound to the actual driving</p>
				</div>
				<ul className="list indent">
					<li>Design a reference system inside the viewport</li>
					<li>Design a pointing device, to ease the direction of the vehicle</li>
					<li>Calibrate the sensibility of the controller's commands</li>
				</ul>
				<div className="orange f2 i pt3">
					Third group
					<p className="f3 navy i">
						Bound to the position of the drone in the environment
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul className="list indent">
					<li>
						Define a visual representation of the data acquired by the LIDAR sensor
					</li>
					<li>
						Design a set of maps, to help positioning the drone in the urban
						environment
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ParImg oneimg="/img/lidar.jpg" />
				<Sec title="The research areas" />
				Defined the challenges, the research field became more clear and delimited.
				It started searching about general robotics, human-machine interaction and
				human-machine interface, with a focus on service robots, I needed a strong
				base of knowledge to comprehend and position the results of the actual
				research, being able to evaluate if they improved our specific project, or
				were general considerations difficult to apply.
				<p className="orange f2 i pt3">First group</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					The key target of this phase were the human factors, cognitive psychology,
					which are the ways humans perceive through the senses, and how these senses
					behave when they're filtered by one or multiple displays, by which we look
					through the drone's eyes, looking for bearings useful in driving;
					everything to find graphic solutions providing for the lack of analog
					signals, making the drive flawless and immersive.
				</p>
				<p className="orange f2 i pt3">Second group</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					Analised the filtered perception in a broad sense, the second group brings
					us in the centre of our project. Thus, the target of the research was to
					find similar situations where other designers had to solve similar issues,
					even in antithetical fields, to find cues for new thoughts. Among other
					examples: HUDs in combat jet fighters, the DaVinci system for telesurgery,
					parking sensors, and control rooms in general.
				</p>
				<p className="orange f2 i pt3">Third group</p>
				<p className="pl4 mb4">
					I searched into the graphic outputs of the LIDAR sensors, to understand
					whether it was possible to take advantage of something already available,
					or if it was necessary designing something new from the ground up.

				<Sec title="Solutions" subtitle="Driving reference system" />
				The main interface whom we interact with is the webcam's stream situated on
				the front side of the vehicle. It has the advantage of a very high
				compression ratio, which doesn't indeed interfere a lot with the bandwidth;
				however with notable disadvantages: the signal's quality is not stable, and
				the optical aberration is quite bothering, making the drive on a straight
				line close to impossible, using only the video stream as a reference. To fix
				these issues, it was decided to use solutions emerged from the research and
				adapt them to our needs.
				<p className="f25 navy pt3 i pb3">Pointing and direction</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					The first thing to be taken into consideration was a central viewfinder, in
					order to have a pointing module, and to have a brief indication of the
					direction of the drone. Which since the first tests proved to be useful,
					but not sufficient. To solve the problem, the solution used is resembling
					the functionality that in cars allows us to park comfortably in reverse;
					using the same mechanism, simply with a front webcam and not with a rear
					one. For straight-line driving, this gives us a precise indication of the
					width of the vehicle's track, and when you intend to turn, the onboard
					computer sends the speed differential between the two wheels to the control
					room and through an algorithm, we are able to have in the viewport the
					indication of the curvature of the trajectory too, through two simple
					beziér curves.
				</p>
				<p className="f25 navy pt3 i pb3">Inclination and slope</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					To overcome the tilting of the vehicle when accelerating and stopping, we
					took inspiration from the artificial horizon present in the aeronautical
					cockpits — originally born as an analogue instrument, and then rendered
					digitally in the HUDs, inserting in the viewport two fixed vertical lines,
					calibrated counting the distortion of the camera , so as to have a fixed
					point of reference when the drone tilts forwards or backwards. The lines
					are white in a vertical position, red when toggling forward and yellow when
					tilting back. This helps us even when the vehicle has to face a climb or a
					descent, enabling the driver to stop when the ascent or descent is too
					steep for the vehicle's internal capabilities.
				</p>
				<p className="f25 navy pt3 i pb3">Speed and acceleration</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					Taking into account the strong distortion given by the wide-angle lens of
					the main camera, and the low power response capability of the two
					controller's joysticks, making acceleration perceptible and having a clear
					speed feedback is fundamental. The joysticks have a discrete motion, but
					zero resistance: I can floor the accelerator, without knowing how much it
					equates in terms of physical acceleration of the vehicle. Resuming the
					research, it was decided to include two separate indicators. One
					responsible for showing the speed of the vehicle, divided over three levels
					(comparable to the gears in cars with an automatic transmission), and the
					other in charge of indicating the level of pressure the driver places on
					the joystick. However, an indication in km/h on the second screen is always
					present.
				</p>
				<Sec subtitle="Perception of depth and position of the vehicle" />
				To solve the perception of depth, starting from the concepts found in the
				research, an integrated indicator cannot be used, as can be for speed, but
				the combination of several visual solutions is necessary, partly exploiting
				the interactivity of the direction indicators, and partly relying on the
				display of data received from the lidar sensor.
				<p className="f25 navy pt3 i pb3">LIDAR sensors</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					the raw data received from the LIDAR and processed by the native software
					made a too chaotic result, going to frustrate its usefulness, therefore the
					development team generated an algorithm to obtain an azimuthal view,
					showing only simple lines defining the perimeters of the closeby elements.
				</p>
				<p className="f25 navy pt3 i pb3">Maps</p>
				<p className="pl4">
					It was therefore decided to use Mapbox, verified its great versatility in
					the customisation of styles, and its precision due to the support on the
					Openstreetmap software. Roads and pedestrian paths can have a really high
					contrast ratio with the buildings, so that visibility is quite high even
					when the map is particularly small, or a glance is given during driving
					operations, where concentration must remain to the camera flow and lidars,
					to avoid any sudden obstacles.

				<Tit tit="Franklin Gothic" />
				<P>
					The ITC Franklin Gothic is a reimagining of Franklin Gothic, a design that
					dates back to 1902. It retains the personality and character of the
					original typeface, with only a slight increase in x-height and character
					width to distinguish it from the first version. Although newer typeface
					families such as Helvetica, Univers and Frutiger have the same basic
					proportions and attributes as Franklin Gothic, the similarity ends there.
					ITC Franklin Gothic retains all the strength and vitality typical of early
					American sans serif typefaces.
					<Br />
					Capitals are wide (typographers would call them “square”), lowercase
					letters share the proportions and letter shapes of serif typefaces – and
					character stroke weights echo the serif-styled counterparts in that they
					have an obvious contrast. For example, the left side of the A is lighter
					than the right, and the first stroke of the M is lighter than the other
					three.

				My journey with Yape has been widely unique.
				<Br />
				I arrived at the company partly unaware of what all the startups were
				actually doing, but Yape, it caught my eye almost instantly. You cannot
				resist falling in love with it the first time you see this funny contraption
				running around the company.
				<Br />
				I wasn’t involved since the very beginning, and the first task I was given
				was the start-up’s corporate image, a work said to be ‘way overdue’ by both
				the Champion and the CDO, and, given I was the only one on the team with
				previous experience, they thought I had the chops to take it home.
				<Br />
				As I said in the{' '}
				<Link to="./enovia">
					<span className="helvetica fw7 f3 link hover-animate hover-green">

					</span>
				</Link>{' '}
				file, soon came out I had to convince a worryingly uninterested CEO about
				what I had designed, and I took it as a personal challenge.
				<Br />
				So I followed a well defined UX process for him to discover the new
				corporate image, with the brief containing only few words:
				<Br />
				<span className="helvetica orange">
					“You have to design something visually powerful and intellectually elegant,
					and you have to design and give a presentation with the only purpose of him
					to like it at first glance”.
				</span>
				<Br />I started researching, as I would with an app or a website. And I soon
				found some key points where I could easily strike and win.
				<Br />
				I took in account his age, what was the design when he was our age, what
				were his personal interests, and what always put a sparkle in his eyes.
				<Br />
				He really liked technology and technology advancements, and revolution in
				the transport industry. I immediately thought I had two aces up my sleeves.
				So I went back and forth to reassure myself I was on the right path.
				<Br />
				What’s the biggest IT company ever existed, which was around when he was our
				age? IBM.
				<Br />
				What’s the company Steve Jobs built after leaving Apple in 1985? NeXT.
				<Br />
				What’s the biggest impact communication design had on transport? The MTA
				signage system in 1966 and The new AmericanAirlines corporate image in 1967.
				<Br />
				What this weird combination of events have in common? The designers.
				<Br />
				Paul Rand designed both the IBM and the NeXT logos, and Massimo Vignelli the
				signage system and the AA corporate image, and sometimes did some work for
				IBM too.
				<Br />
				When narrating the story to the CEO, I used these props to win him over, and

					pieces, and transform every detail into something specifically designed
					around people, the experience, and the impact it has to generate. We are
					designers and architects, it might be difficult to believe, but we cannot
					do everything by ourselves. So, for the sake of best practices, we endorse
					collaborations with third party companies we trust, who will provide the
					necessary experience and skills not directly available. We have in mind an
					iconic space carefully designed by our team of architects, and furnished by
					our interior designers, with lightweight but essential interventions
					customised according to the company’s needs and identity, but keeping the
					users in the centre. The space we want to build will attract and welcome as
					many visitors as possible, allowing them to fully enjoy what we call the
					new <span className="b helvetica fw7">PANTONE</span> Experience: they will
					have the chance to taste a selection of carefully prepared drinks,
					exclusively blended for the specific event by a group of inventive
					bartenders, inspired by a trending palette that{' '}

				Univers was designed by Adrian Frutiger on Swiss principles for Charles
				Peignot at Deberny & Peignot.
				<Br />
				<Br />
				Frutiger imposed strict discipline across all elements of the series, from
				light to dark, extra condensed to extended, a concordance of design that was
				possible in the foundry type and photocomposition fonts. Any version may be
				mixed within a word with any other. It may be argued that the design of the
				most popular central series is limited by strict conformity to little used
				extremes. If Helvetica gives us the strongest central designs at some
				sacrifice in uniformity across the series, Univers gives us a uniform series
				by disciplining the central designs.
				<Br />
				<Br />
				Alteration of character widths required by the Monotype caster separates
				Monotype Univers from the original; the Linotype photocomposition version,
				designed by Frutiger, has a more even color across the series, achieved by
				relaxing the original rigid formula for stroke width.
				<Br />
				<Br />
				IBM Selectric Univers, designed by Frutiger, is less successful, since it
				had to be placed on widths tuned for Times Roman.

				<Tit tit="Neue Haas Grotesk" />
				<P>
					The first weights of Neue Haas Grotesk were designed in 1957-1958 by Max
					Miedinger for the Haas’sche Schriftgiesserei in Switzerland, with art
					direction by the company’s principal, Eduard Hoffmann. Neue Haas Grotesk
					was to be the answer to the British and German grotesques that had become
					hugely popular thanks to the success of functionalist Swiss typography. The
					typeface was soon revised and released as Helvetica by Linotype AG.

				<Tit tit="ITC Garamond" />
				<P>
					Drawn by Tony Stan, ITC Garamond was first released in 1975 in Book and
					Ultra weights only. These were intended as display faces to complement
					existing text designs from other foundries. (In fact, many of ITC’s
					interpretations of traditional typefaces began as display counterparts for
					existing text designs.) These first weights of ITC Garamond became so
					popular, however, that ITC released the Light and Bold weights and a suite
					of condensed faces in 1977. Now, the complete ITC Garamond family features
					sixteen members: four weights of roman and italic in normal width and four
					weights of roman and italic in companion condensed versions. The family
					resemblance is there, but ITC Garamond’s unique provenance gives it an
					unmistakable, one-of-a-kind appeal.

				This logo and Corporate Image have been developed during a workshop with
				Armando Milani giving some fundamental theoric lessons, and his brother
				Maurizio focusing on the production compartment. The very limited group of
				people granted me the possibility to design it four-handedly in a very close
				collaboration with him. Funnily enough, this workshop should have been
				participated by Massimo Vignelli too, but for personal reason had to
				decline.
				<Br />
				Many people feel ashamed showing their first projects. I could dig more into
				the archives and find lots of logos from the 2006-2008 period, but they
				wouldn't be as meaningful as this. And the reason is quite clear. Before
				meeting with Armando and Maurizio, I had a very fond appreciacion of
				everything design-related, but I was skeptical about turning into the core
				business of my profession. So this, rather than the first project at all, is
				the first project I designed with DisciplineDesign in mind, and a remainder
				of a spectacular encounter, where my career started to shape.

					A bold, highly compressed sans-serif typeface in the neo-grotesque style.
					It was designed by Karlgeorg Hoefer for the type foundry Ludwig & Mayer in
					Frankfurt am Main. It was released from 1964 and later issued by a range of

				<Tit tit="Rotis Sans" />
				<P>
					A typeface developed in 1988 by Otl Aicher, who explores an attempt at
					maximum legibility through a highly unified yet varied typeface family that
					ranges from full serif, glyphic, and sans-serif. The four basic Rotis
					variants are: Rotis Serif, Rotis Semi-Serif, Rotis Semi-Sans, Rotis-Sans.
					In this case we used Rotis semi-sans (semi-grotesque) — with zero serifs
					but with stroke width variation
