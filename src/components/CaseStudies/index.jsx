					I was born in the Venice’ countryside, in a family of architects and
					designers. And that has been a strong starting point. Soon after
					middle school, I met Maurizio and Armando Milani, fellow designers of
					Massimo Vignelli, and that ensured me, my path had to be in design
					either, I was, ad am, completely fond. The actual rollercoaster really
					started when in 2008 the aforementioned brothers had at hand a rebrand
					to do, for the cultural centre not far from the school I was
					attending, and called me in, asking if I wanted to join them for a
					closed workshop, with the purpose to deliver the corporate image. I
					accepted. I have always been taught by all-rounders, who perhaps
					didn’t intend to move that part of their knowledge to the actual
					student, because from the 70s many things changed. I soon understood
					by myself I was to be an all rounder too, I’m far too passionate about
					each and every field of design not to be eager to showcase wide
					projects including e.g. a lamp, the packaging, and the ad campaign
					with photos, posters and catalogues to promote this idea machined into
					something real. In high school I majored in printing, graphic design
					and photography. This means I spent almost 30 hours a week either in a
					dark room, developing film, in a printing lab, learning how to
					screen-print, etch zinc, preparing and printing offset plates by hand
					(no digital tools involved) or designing books and corporate images.
					Completed this first deep dive into design, I decided to move to
					London, where I had the possibility to place in the real world all the
					skills I had been sharpening in school labs.

					When choosing which university course to undertake, I considered many,
					but all in all, what I wanted was something as strong as engineering,
					deep as architecture, and detailed as a medium-format photograph. The
					match was Communication Design at the Milan Polytechnic, which
					embodies each and every aspect of my idea of design: disciplined, fast
					paced, and with very strong foundations. This long-lasting learning
					journey, helped me understand what exactly I can deem to be keen on,
					in the infinite field of design. Since the first steps—and of course
					it still hasn’t changed—I felt soundly bound to typography; it started
					I guess when I was asked to draw freehand the whole Bodoni and Neue
					Haas Grotesk alphabets, back in 2007, and that set off the basic
					instinct to become really accurate in seizing the right font, kerning
					and typographical grid for each and every task. Since I spent a lot of
					time learning how to actually print, the fastest turnaround was to
					step back, and understand how to design something in order to shape
					precisely the final printed result; so I approached designing books,
					catalogues, and anything that could stand on paper. Never forgetting
					the digital world growing around me, and trying to translate the rules
					drawn for printing, into digital objects.

					<p className="helvetica pt2 pb2 silver fw7">Process</p>
					<p className="pb2">
						The first stage of the process consisted in a vast analysis of all
						the available material of both the existing and the future lines, in
						order to comprehend the vastness and complexity of the system, and
						its actual wayfinding. The outcome of this research has shown vast
						possibilities of improvement, from both a design and infrastructural
						integration perspective, to solve the lack of scalability,
						legibility, and consistency.<br></br>
						<br></br> The second stage consisted in the evaluation of the
						available channels to convey information through, which consist in:
						map, station signage, train signage, etc.<br></br>
						<br></br>The third stage consisted in the developement of a coherent
						system, which takes advantage of the stations’ architecture, has a
						inner modularity (hence using the pillars), and provides in a clear
						way the few but essential informations (station name, train
						direction, entries and exits)
					</p>
					<hr className="navy"></hr>
					<p className="pt3">
						Whether you’re an urban dweller passing through the turnstiles on a
						daily basis, or a first-time visitor using it to navigate your way
						through the countless stations of the network, an effective,
						coherent and, last but not least, visually pleasant design is of the
						essence. Designing the system of signs and bits of information that
						guide people through such a complex experience it’s about
						understanding what billions of passengers look for, where they look
						for it and, ultimately, provide it, in the least confusing way
						possible. Avoiding confusion goes hand in hand with one key element:
						coherence. As the most effective wayfinding and navigational systems
						in the world have proved, the higher the coherence among all the
						different media involved is, the clearer and more usable the network
						is. Besides coherence, scalability is of the utter importance to
						ensure the easiest adaptability to future developments of the
						infrastructure. A coherent, scalable, aesthetically challenging
						concept is what we are offering here. Acting beforehand, while the
						whole system is still being built and designed will dramatically
						reduce the future need of a system-wide overhaul, to bring all the
						single segments of it to the same communicative level. Failing in
						doing so, raises the risk of ending up with a labyrinth of
						mismatched signage and overlapping communication styles with no real
						pattern or logic. Furthermore, with the ever growing international
						popularity of graphic design standards, corporate identity, and
						public awareness of ‘good design’, it becomes more and more clear
						that an underground network needs a fresh visual identity and a more
						effective navigational system. Our proposal uses a single strategy
						to reach both goals: adopting a single but distinctive language
						across all the different media (maps, posters, physical signage,
						architecture, collaterals) makes it easier for travellers to find
						their destination while creating a distinctive and iconic look,
						similar to those making the great metropolitan networks of the world
						stand out.
