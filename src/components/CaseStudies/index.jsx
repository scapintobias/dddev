          I was born in the Venice’ countryside, in a family of architects and designers. And that has been a strong starting point. Soon after middle school, I met Maurizio and Armando Milani, fellow designers of Massimo Vignelli, and that ensured me, my path had to be in design either, I was, ad am, completely fond. The actual rollercoaster really started when in 2008 the aforementioned brothers had at hand a rebrand to do, for the cultural centre not far from the school I was attending, and called me in, asking if I wanted to join them for a closed workshop, with the purpose to deliver the corporate image. I accepted. I have always been taught by all-rounders, who perhaps didn’t intend to move that part of their knowledge to the actual student, because from the 70s many things changed. I soon understood by myself I was to be an all rounder too, I’m far too passionate about each and every field of design not to be eager to showcase wide projects including e.g. a lamp, the packaging, and the ad campaign with photos, posters and catalogues to promote this idea machined into something real. In high school I majored in printing, graphic design and photography. This means I spent almost 30 hours a week either in a dark room, developing film, in a printing lab, learning how to screen-print, etch zinc, preparing and printing offset plates by hand (no digital tools involved) or designing books and corporate images. Completed this first deep dive into design, I decided to move to London, where I had the possibility to place in the real world all the skills I had been sharpening in school labs.

          When choosing which university course to undertake, I considered many, but all in all, what I wanted was something as strong as engineering, deep as architecture, and detailed as a medium-format photograph. The match was Communication Design at the Milan Polytechnic, which embodies each and every aspect of my idea of design: disciplined, fast paced, and with very strong foundations. This long-lasting learning journey, helped me understand what exactly I can deem to be keen on, in the infinite field of design. Since the first steps—and of course it still hasn’t changed—I felt soundly bound to typography; it started I guess when I was asked to draw freehand the whole Bodoni and Neue Haas Grotesk alphabets, back in 2007, and that set off the basic instinct to become really accurate in seizing the right font, kerning and typographical grid for each and every task. Since I spent a lot of time learning how to actually print, the fastest turnaround was to step back, and understand how to design something in order to shape precisely the final printed result; so I approached designing books, catalogues, and anything that could stand on paper. Never forgetting the digital world growing around me, and trying to translate the rules drawn for printing, into digital objects.

          My final project at university has been the redesign of a poem collection by Aldo Palazzeschi, which was published in 1930; resulting a quite successful effort to combine poetry and photography, in a visual book. Beyond those two major aspects, I tried in the years to channel my hobbies and passions into facets of my professional spectrum, be it photography, wayfinding, music production, industrial, web, or exhibit design. Architecture had a strong impact on my design taste, and has been part of my life ever since; many years ago I started a blog, trying to collect everything I liked, ranging from design to civil engineering. In these years, since 2009, I started my own design consultancy, named DisciplineDesign, based between Milan and London. The motto is ‘Design support, from the spoon to the city’, quoting Ernesto Nathan Rogers.

          I have always been fascinated about public transportation. Living in Milan gave me the possibility to peruse its iconic wayfinding system, which later led the shaping of the MTA, Washington DC and São Paolo signage systems. So I was very excited when proposed with this project.
