					and Product design. Many of my colleagues accepted almost any offer
					they were given—indeed not considering ux-related offers only—just to

					When my MS courses finished on January 2018, everybody was just
					missing the mandatory internship. In order to graduate, Politecnico
					wanted everybody to do a 250-hours internship, to summarise all the
					expertise gained in the last two semesters, focused primarily on UX
					and Product design. Many of my colleagues accepted almost any offer
					they were given—indeed not considering ux-related offers only—just to
					put in the hours. I decided to approach this differently.
					<Br />I wanted to land an internship which was longer than the
					mandatory 250 hours (spoiler: at the end the hours were exactly one
					thousand) extremely UX focused, in a corporate environment but with
					some start-up ingredients. The company should have been in the tech
					industry, and I should have had complete and indiscriminate access to
					engineers of all sorts.
					<Br />
					Yes, I like to set the bar quite high, but I guess is the only way of
					achieving something.
					<p className="helvetica fw7 pt3">The catch</p>I started looking into
					all the incubators distributed well around the city, but no one seemed
					to have an in-house design team, or being even vaguely design driven,
					so I moved on. One afternoon I was giving the last chance to my
					university’s career service, and I stumbled into this open position
					for a UX/UI internship at e-Novia, The Enterprises Factory. Sounded
					impressive. I then packed up my portfolio, and sent the application.
					<Br />
					The interviews went through quite smoothly, and just days from the end
					of May, I met the team and started the journey.
					<hr className="navy mt4"></hr>
					<p className="helvetica fw7 pt3">The company</p>
					e-Novia is indeed design driven. Anything that happens, comes from the
					joined design studios, industrial and UX/UI, a team of ten designers
					who respond to the needs of the 14 startups the company is growing. I
					had two senior colleagues whom I was very honoured to be mentored by,
					helping me learn all the blurred lines UX design is made of, and I
					responded directly to an energetic CDO, always very concerned about
					the team working well together, growth paths and whatnot. I almost
					instantly felt at home, something very difficult in this kind of big
					tech industries.
					<Br />
					Previously I said I wanted “complete and indiscriminate access to
					engineers of all sorts”. Well. Now I was surrounded by nearly 90
					between software developers and engineers of the most various sort:
					computer, electronics, automation, mechanic, whatnot. I was in awe.
					Moreover, as time went by, and my learning curve turned into a
					plateau, I became more and more reliable, obtaining the respect and
					trust of each one of them, and that’s the best takeaway I can think
					of, when reminiscing about this experience.
					<hr className="navy mt4"></hr>
					<p className="helvetica fw7 pt3">My role</p>
					Considered I was actually the last one arrived at the company, and I
					was covering just an internship position, I have never been treated
					like one. I was part of the team, had the same responsibilities of the
					others, the same opportunities to raise my voice and convey opinions,
					which were always listened to and pondered on. From a confidence point
					of view, that has been a huge boost from the very beginning.
					<Br />I mainly focused on collaborative mobility, SaaS and augmented
					reality, with the startups Yape, Blimp and Weart, developing a wide
					range of hard and soft skills, from brainstorming and early-sketches
					of ideas, wireframing, defining the experience, low and high fidelity
					mockups, user testing and whatnot, to the polished finished interfaces
					delivered to the developers for implementation and following
					iterations.
					<Br />
					Having spent my teen age learning how to move through different
					programming languages, I’m maybe not be a master of any, but I have
					enough valuable knowledge to have a productive conversation with
					developers, and even when designing, I always keep in mind the
					boundaries of code, discussing even when we might be able to push them
					without too much of an effort, to achieve something new.
					<Br />
					If you want to know more in detail what I did in the projects I was
					involved in, you can peak at the specific files.

					I was born in the Venice’ countryside, in a family of architects and
					designers. And that has been a strong starting point. Soon after
					middle school, I met Maurizio and Armando Milani, fellow designers of
					Massimo Vignelli, and that ensured me, my path had to be in design
					either, I was, ad am, completely fond. The actual rollercoaster really
					started when in 2008 the aforementioned brothers had at hand a rebrand
					to do, for the cultural centre not far from the school I was
					attending, and called me in, asking if I wanted to join them for a
					closed workshop, with the purpose to deliver the corporate image. I
					accepted. I have always been taught by all-rounders, who perhaps
					didn’t intend to move that part of their knowledge to the actual
					student, because from the 70s many things changed. I soon understood
					by myself I was to be an all rounder too, I’m far too passionate about
					each and every field of design not to be eager to showcase wide
					projects including e.g. a lamp, the packaging, and the ad campaign
					with photos, posters and catalogues to promote this idea machined into
					something real. In high school I majored in printing, graphic design
					and photography. This means I spent almost 30 hours a week either in a
					dark room, developing film, in a printing lab, learning how to
					screen-print, etch zinc, preparing and printing offset plates by hand
					(no digital tools involved) or designing books and corporate images.
					Completed this first deep dive into design, I decided to move to
					London, where I had the possibility to place in the real world all the
					skills I had been sharpening in school labs.

					When choosing which university course to undertake, I considered many,
					but all in all, what I wanted was something as strong as engineering,
					deep as architecture, and detailed as a medium-format photograph. The
					match was Communication Design at the Milan Polytechnic, which
					embodies each and every aspect of my idea of design: disciplined, fast
					paced, and with very strong foundations. This long-lasting learning
					journey, helped me understand what exactly I can deem to be keen on,
					in the infinite field of design. Since the first steps—and of course
					it still hasn’t changed—I felt soundly bound to typography; it started
					I guess when I was asked to draw freehand the whole Bodoni and Neue
					Haas Grotesk alphabets, back in 2007, and that set off the basic
					instinct to become really accurate in seizing the right font, kerning
					and typographical grid for each and every task. Since I spent a lot of
					time learning how to actually print, the fastest turnaround was to
					step back, and understand how to design something in order to shape
					precisely the final printed result; so I approached designing books,
					catalogues, and anything that could stand on paper. Never forgetting
					the digital world growing around me, and trying to translate the rules
					drawn for printing, into digital objects.

					My final project at university has been the redesign of a poem
					collection by Aldo Palazzeschi, which was published in 1930; resulting
					a quite successful effort to combine poetry and photography, in a
					visual book. Beyond those two major aspects, I tried in the years to
					channel my hobbies and passions into facets of my professional
					spectrum, be it photography, wayfinding, music production, industrial,
					web, or exhibit design. Architecture had a strong impact on my design
					taste, and has been part of my life ever since; many years ago I
					started a blog, trying to collect everything I liked, ranging from
					design to civil engineering. In these years, since 2009, I started my
					own design consultancy, named DisciplineDesign, based between Milan
					and London. The motto is ‘Design support, from the spoon to the city’,
					quoting Ernesto Nathan Rogers.
