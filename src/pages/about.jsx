        I was born in the Venice’ countryside, in a family of carpenters, architects and designers. And that has been a strong starting point. Soon after middle school, I met Maurizio and Armando Milani, fellow designers of Massimo Vignelli, and they unconsciously instilled in me the idea that design, all in all, wasn't that of a bad choice as a career. I was very young, already very hungry for informations and knowledge, but yet to be molded into something—let's say 'useful' for myself, and perhaps for the rest of humanity too. The actual rollercoaster started two years or so later, in 2008, when I was senior in high school. The aforementioned brothers had at hand a rebrand to do, for the cultural centre not far from the school I was attending, so they set up a workshop, with the purpose for the students to deliver the corporate image. Then something strange happened: it seemed to me I was the only one interested in what they had to offer, both as critique, anecdotes, or other teachings of the most various sort; which, instead, I was a lot more than willing to absorbe. Aside from them, all over high school I have always been taught by all-rounders, who perhaps didn’t intend to move that part of their knowledge to the actual student—me—because from the 70s many things changed. I soon understood by myself I wanted to be an all rounder too, I was far too passionate about each and every field of design not to be eager to showcase wide projects including e.g. a lamp, the packaging, the website and the ad campaign with photos, posters and catalogues to promote this idea machined into something real. In high school I majored in printing, graphic design and photography. This meant I spent almost 30 hours a week either in a dark room, developing film, in a printing lab, learning how to screen-print, etch zinc, preparing and printing offset plates by hand (no digital tools involved) or designing books and corporate images. Completed this first deep dive into design, for my gap year I decided to have a move to London, where I had the possibility to place in the real world all the skills I had been sharpening in school labs. When choosing which university course to undertake, I considered many, but all in all, what I wanted was something as strong as engineering, deep as architecture, and detailed as a medium-format photograph. The match was Communication Design at the Milan Polytechnic, which embodies each and every aspect of my idea of design: disciplined, fast paced, and with very strong foundations. This long-lasting learning journey, helped me understand what exactly I can deem to be keen on, in the infinite fields of design. Since the first steps—and of course it still hasn’t changed—I felt soundly bound to typography; it started I guess when I was asked to draw freehand the whole Bodoni and Neue Haas Grotesk alphabets, back in 2007, and that set off the basic instinct to become really accurate in seizing the right font, kerning and typographical grid for each and every task. Since I spent a lot of time learning how to actually print, the fastest turnaround was to step back, and understand how to design something in order to shape precisely the final printed result; so I approached designing books, catalogues, and anything that could stand on paper. Never forgetting the digital world growing around me, and trying to translate the rules drawn for printing, into digital objects. At this stage, I had a vast experience as a freelancer, spanning almost 8 years, with clients involving me mostly into printed projects, such as books, catalogues, etc, and I started fearing to miss out on the huge revolution revolving around apps, dynamic websites, and interfaces altogether. So, after getting my bachelor in february 2016, I took another year working on projects more towards interaction design and for filling the gaps in my knowledge in order not to make a fool of myself if I wanted to enter the master of science in user experience and interaction design at my university (that still fell under the umbrella name of 'communication design' at the time). And so I enrolled, in february 2017, starting a whole new chapter. I gained my degree in april 2019 with a thesis on 'User Experience design for land-drones remote driving', theme arose from my work experience during this time, which you can find writings about in the <Link className="helvetica fw7 f4 link hover-silver" to="/case-studies/eNovia">e-Novia</Link> file.
